This project practices the steps involved in a typical analytics project including:
1. Gathering Data
2. Assessing Data
3. Cleaning Data
4. Visualization

This project gathers data from the twitter handle @WeRateDogs using the twitter API.
Two other files are downloaded including twitter_archive_enhanced.csv and image_predictions.tsv.
The image_predictions.tsv is downloaded programatically in Python.

This project adresses the issues of Data Quality and Data Tidiness and transforms the data into a format easy for analysis.
The final analysis includes visualizing trends and patterns in how a particular breed or age-group of a dog affects the number of likes or retweets attracted by it.

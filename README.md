# About
[WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "[they're good dogs Brent](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-good-dogs-brent)." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

This repo studies the tweets from WeRateDogs by performing wrangling from a variety of sources and assessing its quality and tidiness issues. This is followed by a brief analysis of the data producing basic visualizations using matplotlib and Seaborn

# Data
The data is gathered from the twitter handle @WeRateDogs using the twitter API. <br>
Two more files are downloaded, including `twitter_archive_enhanced.csv` and `image_predictions.tsv` from Udacity's Classroom. <br>
The `image_predictions.tsv`, provided by Udacity is downloaded programatically in Python. <br><br>
Following are the Python Libraries used for wrangling and analysis:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- requests
- tweepy
- json

# Analysis
The Analysis has been carried out with documentation in a Jupyter Notebook: `wrangle_act.ipynb` <br>
The Notebook can be downloaded from the repo [here](https://github.com/dhavalpotdar/WeRateDogs/blob/master/wrangle_act.ipynb) or previewed in the browser [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dhavalpotdar/WeRateDogs/blob/master/wrangle_act.ipynb).

# Report
A brief report highlighting the findings: `act_report.pdf` can be found [here](https://github.com/dhavalpotdar/WeRateDogs/blob/master/act_report.pdf).
